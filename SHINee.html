        <p>SHINee is a South Korean pop band made up of five members (last name, first name): Lee Jinki, Kim Jonghyun, Kim Kibum, Choi Minho and Lee Taemin. 
            Their name means "to receive light", much like the words "employee" is to be employed, since their fanlights illuminate them during their concerts, they are the ones receiving the light.
            SHINee debuted in 2018 with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTASffPQGhY"target="_blank">Replay</a> - a romantic song dedicated to the noonas (korean for an older females).
